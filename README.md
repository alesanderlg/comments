# Comments

Project for React Dev course. The goal is to implement a project from scratch which contains a list of comments from the user using React.

Remember that a good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component.

## Getting Started

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`

## What You're Getting
```bash
├── README.md - This file.
├── package.json # npm package manager file. It's unlikely that you'll need to modify this.
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico # React Icon, You may change if you wish.
│   └── index.html # DO NOT MODIFY
└── src
    ├── App.css # Styles for your app. Feel free to customize this as you desire.
    ├── App.js # This is the root of your app. Contains static HTML right now.
    ├── App.test.js # Used for testing. Provided with Create React App. Testing is encouraged, but not required.
    ├── index.css # Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
    └── index.js # You should not need to modify this file. It is used for DOM rendering only.
```
